# 💱 Currency Converter

## 📝 Overview
This is a simple console-based Java program that converts amounts from **US Dollars (USD)** to other currencies — including **Euros (EUR)**, **British Pounds (GBP)**, **Japanese Yen (JPY)**, and **Mexican Pesos (MXN)**.

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate basic Java skills such as user input, conditionals, and arithmetic operations in a practical real-world scenario.
